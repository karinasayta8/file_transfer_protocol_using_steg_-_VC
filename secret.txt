Types of Cryptography:
Symmetric Encryption:

Same key is used for encryption and decryption.

Examples: AES, DES, Blowfish.

Asymmetric Encryption:

Uses a pair of keys (public and private).

Examples: RSA, ECC.

Hashing:

Converts data into a fixed-length hash.

Examples: SHA-256, MD5.

Digital Signatures:

Ensures message authenticity and integrity.

Used in blockchain and secure communication.

üîê Applications:
Secure messaging (WhatsApp, Signal)

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies

SSL/TLS in web browsers

Password storage and authentication

Here‚Äôs a detailed overview of cryptography! üîê

üìö 1. Introduction to Cryptography
Cryptography secures data by transforming it into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered by authorized users. It protects information from unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

üîí 2. Core Principles of Cryptography
Confidentiality: Ensures that only authorized parties can access information.

Integrity: Guarantees that data is not modified or tampered with.

Authentication: Verifies the identity of the sender or receiver.

Non-repudiation: Prevents denial of having sent or received a message.

üß† 3. Types of Cryptography
1Ô∏è‚É£ Symmetric Key Cryptography
How it works:

Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.

Fast and efficient but less secure if the key is compromised.

Examples:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Strong encryption standard used in secure communications.

DES (Data Encryption Standard): Older algorithm, replaced by AES due to vulnerabilities.

Blowfish/Twofish: Block ciphers used for secure data encryption.

Use Cases:

File encryption

Database encryption

VPNs for secure communication

2Ô∏è‚É£ Asymmetric Key Cryptography (Public-Key Cryptography)
How it works:

Uses two keys: a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.

Provides stronger security but slower due to complex computations.

Examples:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Widely used for secure web communications.

ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): Faster and more secure alternative to RSA.

Diffie-Hellman: Key exchange protocol used to establish secure channels.

Use Cases:

Digital signatures

Secure email communication

TLS/SSL certificates

3Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing
How it works:

Converts data into a fixed-length string that cannot be reversed.

Ensures data integrity but not confidentiality.

Examples:

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm): Used in blockchain and password storage.

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm): Fast but vulnerable to collisions.

BLAKE2/Bcrypt: Modern alternatives with stronger security.

Use Cases:

Password hashing

Blockchain data integrity

Digital signatures

4Ô∏è‚É£ Digital Signatures
How it works:

Uses a combination of hashing and asymmetric cryptography to verify message authenticity.

Ensures non-repudiation and message integrity.

Process:

Hash the message.

Encrypt the hash with the sender‚Äôs private key.

Receiver decrypts the hash using the sender‚Äôs public key and compares it with the original hash.

Use Cases:

Code signing

Digital certificates

Email and document verification

üîê 4. Cryptographic Techniques
‚úÖ 1. Encryption & Decryption

Transforms plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.

Symmetric and asymmetric techniques used depending on the use case.

‚úÖ 2. Key Exchange Protocols

Securely exchange cryptographic keys between parties.

Diffie-Hellman: Widely used for establishing shared secrets.

‚úÖ 3. Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

Ensures message integrity and authenticity.

Uses a secret key to generate a MAC attached to the message.

‚úÖ 4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

Verifies knowledge without revealing actual information.

Used in privacy-preserving protocols and blockchain systems.

üõ°Ô∏è 5. Applications of Cryptography
Secure Communication:

HTTPS, SSL/TLS for web security

VPNs and encrypted emails

Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies:

Bitcoin and Ethereum use asymmetric cryptography and hashing.

Digital Certificates:

Validates website authenticity and protects against phishing.

Password Protection:

Hashing and salting protect stored passwords from attackers.

Secure File Sharing:

Encrypted file storage and transfer with confidentiality and integrity.

‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Cryptographic Attacks
Brute-force Attack: Exhaustively tries all possible keys.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM): Intercepts communication between two parties.

Replay Attack: Replays previously transmitted messages.

Side-channel Attack: Exploits information leakage from a system.

üöÄ 7. Modern Cryptography Trends
Post-Quantum Cryptography: Developing algorithms resistant to quantum computing.

Homomorphic Encryption: Allows computations on encrypted data.

Blockchain-based Security: Enhances transparency and data immutability.

üîé 8. Cryptography in Real Life
WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption.

Online banking transactions rely on SSL/TLS.

Bitcoin and Ethereum employ cryptographic hashing and digital signatures.
